// The visualizer's ear (Visualizer.h): the last moments of what Spotify plays, as bars. Plain C with no
// allocation after it is set up, so the tap (VisualizerTap.x) can feed it from Core Audio's render thread
// and the view read it once a frame on the main one; tested on the Mac or Linux against harness/visualizer/.
//
// The tap writes mono samples into SGSpectrumRing, a single writer and a single reader, the reader taking
// the newest SGSpectrumWindow of them whenever it likes: a frame drawn from a window the writer moved on
// from halfway through is one 120th of a second of a slightly smeared picture, never a crash.
//
// SGSpectrumAnalyzer turns the newest `size` samples of a window into `count` bars, each 0...1: 1024 of them
// (23 ms at 44.1 kHz, so a beat shows as it lands) and the whole 2048 for Bass, which needs the finer bins
// low down; a Hann window, a radix-2 FFT, the bins
// summed into bands spaced evenly on a log scale over what is followed, each band's level in decibels
// against the loudest the music has been lately (falling slowly, so a quiet song still moves), then the
// strength, and a fast rise and a slower fall. Follows, as Music Haptics has it (Shared/Haptics):
//     Everything  40 Hz to 14 kHz, every band at its level
//     Beat        the same bands, each lifted by how fast it just rose, so the drums jump out
//     Bass        25 Hz to 250 Hz across the whole ring
